# The Green Alliance
Team 4909's 2018+ Scouting System.

We built The Green Alliance to alleviate many of the difficulties regarding scouting.

## Input Device Configurations
The Green Alliance supports a variety of input device configurations to accomodate the workflows of most teams, both offline and online. 

- 6 Devices (Laptop/Tablet/Phone) Connected to Cloud Server
  - Syncs directly to Cloud
- 6 Kindle Fires Connected to Raspberry Pi
  - Connected via Bluetooth
- 6 Laptops Connected to Raspberry Pi
  - Connected via a Ethernet switch

In all of the above configurations, teams must have a laptop to effectively visualize the scouting data and fetching data from an offline Raspberry Pi requires the use of an Ethernet cable.

Please note that all the configurations will auto-sync when any of the devices are connected to the internet.

## Bugs / Feature Requests
Please create a GitHub issue for any bugs or new feature requests.
